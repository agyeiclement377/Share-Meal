# Share-Meal
Share Meal is a compassionate project aimed at reducing food waste and supporting those in need by facilitating the donation of surplus food. The project serves as a platform for individuals and organizations to share meals with the less fortunate, promoting community engagement and social responsibility.

Share Meal's core functionality includes an intuitive interface for donors to list food items available for donation, specifying details such as quantity, expiry date, and any special instructions. Needy individuals or organizations can then browse these listings and request the food items they require.

The project also emphasizes sustainability by encouraging the donation of perishable items that would otherwise go to waste. Through Share Meal, users can contribute to reducing food waste while making a positive impact on the lives of others.

With a user-friendly design and a focus on accessibility, Share Meal aims to connect donors and recipients seamlessly, fostering a sense of unity and empathy within communities.

THE STATE OF FOOD WASTE IN GHANA

Food waste remains a critical concern in Ghana, where nearly one-third of all food produced is lost or wasted. This issue is particularly poignant considering the prevalence of food insecurity in the country. 

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), around 5 million Ghanaians are undernourished, highlighting the urgency of addressing food waste in a manner that promotes equitable access to nutrition.

In addition to that, as per the Global Food Banking, it is estimated that approximately 3.2 million tons of food is either lost or wasted along the supply chain in Ghana, costing about 762.32 billion in Ghanaian cedis (GHâ‚µ).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
